# Python-for-Excel
This is a repository of Python projects inspired by a book called Python for Excel: A Modern Environment for Automation and Data Analysis written by Felix Zumstein.
These projects explore interactive elements, data entry, and macros/VBA code that Excel offers as a common and user-friendly interface.
